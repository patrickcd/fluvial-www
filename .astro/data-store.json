We build them to help you do your best work. There are millions of people using Lexington products every day. Because we don’t know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.\n\nWhen we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to [Lexington LLC](#_). We spun off Highrise HQ, LLC in the past, but it has since rejoined Lexington LLC.\n\nWhen we say “Services”, we mean our websites, including Lexington.com, hey.com, and Lexington.com, and any product created and maintained by Lexington LLC. That includes Lexington (all versions), HEY, Highrise, Campfire, Backpack, Ta-da List, and Writeboard, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.\n\nWhen we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services. We have specific ownership policies for our products: [Lexington 4](#_), [Lexington 2](#_), [Lexington Classic](#_), [HEY for Domains](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_) and [Backpack](#_).\n\nWe may update these Terms of Service (\"Terms\") in the future. You can track all changes made since mid-2018 [on GitHub](#_). Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.\n\nWhen you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. **These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**\n\nIf you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about [who we are](#_), [how we work](#_), and keeping an open door to [your feedback](#_).\n\nAccount Terms\n-------------\n\n1.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend all users set up [two-factor authentication](#_) for added security. In some of our Services, we may require it.\n2.  You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Use Restrictions policy](#_), and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.\n3.  You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.\n4.  You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.\n\nPayment, Refunds, and Plan Changes\n----------------------------------\n\n1.  If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.\n2.  For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation. See our [Cancellation policy](#_) for more details.\n3.  If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.\n4.  All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. See our [Taxes policy](#_) for more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.\n5.  We process refunds according to our [Fair Refund policy](#_).\n\nCancellation and Termination\n----------------------------\n\n1.  You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our [Cancellation policy](#_). An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always [contact our Support team](#_).\n2.  All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted. If you want to export any data before your account is canceled, we‘ve provided instructions for [HEY](#_), [Lexington 4](#_), [Lexington 2](#_), [Lexington Classic](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_), and [Backpack](#_).\n3.  If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing cycle. See our [Fair Refund policy](#_) for more details.\n4.  We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](#_).\n5.  Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.\n\nModifications to the Service and Prices\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  We make a promise to our customers to support our Services [until the end of the Internet](#_). That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.\n2.  Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.\n\nUptime, Security, and Privacy\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services — here’s [the one exception](#_) — but do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit [https://www.37status.com](#_) to see the status of our Services.\n2.  We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.\n3.  We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to our [Security Overview](#_) for full details and our [Security Response page](#_) for how to report a security incident or threat.\n4.  When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Lexington may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](#_) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:\n\n    *   **To help you with support requests you make.** We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.\n    *   **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.\n    *   **To safeguard Lexington.** We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an [abuse report investigation](#_).\n    *   **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-US authority approaches Lexington for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Lexington is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.\n5.  We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for [Lexington](#_), [HEY](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_), and [Backpack](#_), as well as a list of [Company processors](#_).\n\n6.  Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Lexington is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms, the [Privacy policy](#_), and [other policies](#_). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use Lexington’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.\n7.  These Terms incorporate the [Lexington Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)](#_) when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) applies to your use of Lexington Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA linked above supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and Lexington LLC relating to your use of the Lexington Services.\n\nCopyright and Content Ownership\n-------------------------------\n\n1.  All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law. We provide details on [how to file a copyright infringement claim](#_).\n2.  You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.\n3.  We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.\n4.  The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company’s logos or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [email us](#_) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any permissions if you violate these Terms.\n5.  You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.\n\nFeatures and Bugs\n-----------------\n\nWe design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.\n\nWe also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.\n\nServices Adaptations and API Terms\n----------------------------------\n\nWe offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our Services (currently Lexington, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack). Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:\n\n1.  You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.\n2.  Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user’s activity _other than time tracking_, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.\n3.  Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account’s access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.\n\nSome third-party providers have created integrations between our Services and theirs. You can find some of those integrations for Lexington at [https://Lexington.com/extras](#_) and for Highrise at [https://highrisehq.com/extras](#_). We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.\n\nLiability\n---------\n\nWe mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:\n\n**_You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability._**\n\nIn other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general [giving a damn](#_). If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.\n\nIf you have a question about any of these Terms, please [contact our Support team](#_).","src/content/infopages/terms.md","b9acd14edd1fc399",{"html":320,"metadata":321},"\u003Ch2 id=\"all-the-terms-that-you-agree-to-when-you-sign-up-for-a-lexington-product\">All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Lexington product.\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>From everyone at Lexington, thank you for using our products!

From rising inflation to evolving trade policies, governments and businesses worldwide are adapting to new challenges. Here’s a look at some of the most impactful economic trends shaping the world this year.\r\n\r\n## 1. Inflation and Interest Rates\r\n\r\nMany countries are facing persistent inflation, prompting central banks to adjust interest rates. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan are all implementing monetary policies aimed at stabilizing their economies. However, balancing growth with inflation control remains a critical challenge.\r\n\r\n## 2. Emerging Markets on the Rise\r\n\r\nDeveloping nations in Asia and Africa are seeing increased investment, driven by technological advancements and a young workforce.

The Energy Transition\r\n\r\nThe shift to renewable energy continues to accelerate, with governments implementing stricter policies on fossil fuel use. Solar, wind, and nuclear energy investments are at an all-time high, reshaping the global energy landscape.\r\n\r\n## 4. Geopolitical Tensions Affecting Trade\r\n\r\nOngoing conflicts and diplomatic standoffs are disrupting global supply chains. Tensions between major economies like the U.S. and China, as well as the ongoing situation in Eastern Europe, are influencing commodity prices and international trade agreements.\r\n![Stock Market Graph](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519891880039-45e173a95f14?q=80&w=2664&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\r\n\r\n## 5. The Future of Work and AI\r\n\r\nAutomation and artificial intelligence are reshaping labor markets. While AI boosts efficiency, concerns about job displacement and ethical AI governance are growing. Governments are working on policies to ensure a smooth transition into this new era of work.\r\n\r\n## 6. Digital Currencies and Decentralized Finance\r\n\r\nWith countries like China advancing their digital yuan and Bitcoin gaining wider adoption, decentralized finance (DeFi) is disrupting traditional banking systems. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to keep pace with these innovations.\r\n\r\n## 7. Global Food Security Challenges\r\n\r\nClimate change and conflicts are affecting food supply chains, leading to higher prices and shortages in several regions. Governments and organizations are investing in sustainable agricultural technologies to combat these issues.\r\n| Economic Indicator | 2024 | 2025 (Projected) |\r\n|--------------------|------|-----------------|\r\n| Global GDP Growth | 2.9% | 3.2% |\r\n| Inflation Rate (US) | 4.1% | 3.5% |\r\n| Renewable Energy Investment | $500B | $600B |\r\nAs we navigate 2025, staying informed on these global economic trends will be crucial for businesses, investors, and policymakers.

From new leadership in key countries to evolving economic policies, here’s a look at the crucial developments shaping Europe’s future.\r\n\r\n## 1. Political Realignments Across the Continent\r\n\r\nSeveral European countries have undergone elections, leading to shifts in government policies. The European Union continues to navigate tensions between member states, while national governments adjust to changing public sentiments on issues like migration, climate policy, and economic reforms.\r\n\r\n## 2. Economic Challenges and Opportunities\r\n\r\nWith inflation stabilizing after years of volatility, European economies are focusing on growth and sustainability. The energy sector, in particular, is seeing a significant shift as countries phase out fossil fuels in favor of renewables, leading to new investment opportunities.\r\n\r\n## 3. The Green Transition and Energy Security\r\n\r\nEurope’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions remains strong, but challenges persist in ensuring energy security. The ongoing shift to renewable energy sources is reshaping industrial and consumer markets, with governments implementing ambitious climate policies.\r\n\r\n## 4. Trade and Relations with Global Partners\r\n\r\nTrade agreements between the EU, the US, and Asian markets continue to evolve. Brexit’s long-term impact is becoming clearer, with the UK and EU refining their trade relations. Meanwhile, European nations are working to reduce dependency on external suppliers in critical industries.\r\n![European Parliament](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519891880039-45e173a95f14?q=80&w=2664&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\r\n\r\n## 5. Technological Innovations and Digital Policies\r\n\r\nThe European Union is pushing forward new regulations on artificial intelligence and digital privacy. As tech companies expand their operations across Europe, regulatory bodies are striving to maintain a balance between innovation and consumer protection.\r\n\r\n## 6. Migration Policies and Social Integration\r\n\r\nAs global conflicts and economic disparities drive migration into Europe, governments are adjusting policies to ensure both economic growth and social stability. The integration of migrants into the workforce remains a critical focus area.\r\n\r\n## 7. Security and Defense Strategies\r\n\r\nAmid rising geopolitical tensions, European countries are increasing their defense budgets and strengthening security alliances. NATO and EU defense initiatives are playing a crucial role in ensuring stability in the region.\r\n| Key Indicator | 2024 | 2025 (Projected) |\r\n|--------------|------|-----------------|\r\n| EU GDP Growth | 2.1% | 2.5% |\r\n| Renewable Energy Adoption | 45% | 52% |\r\n| Digital Economy Growth | 8% | 10% |\r\nAs Europe navigates these complex challenges and opportunities, staying informed about political and economic shifts will be crucial for businesses, policymakers, and citizens alike.

This wastes time, introduces errors, and makes updates difficult when information changes.\n\n## How Fluvial Works\n\nFluvial treats documents as living connections to your questionnaire data, not one-time exports.\n\n### Define Your Document Structure\n\nCreate templates for the types of documents you need—vendor profiles, compliance reports, service agreements, or rating summaries. These templates define what information each document contains and how it should be organised.\n\n### Connect Questions to Documents\n\nSet up reusable connections between your questionnaire questions and document fields. When a question asks for a company name, certification status, or risk rating, you specify where that information should appear in your documents. These connections can be saved and used again for future assessments.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\nsubgraph Q1[\"Risk Assessment Project A\"]\nQE1[\"Q 123\u003Cbr/>Company Name: 'Acme Corp'\"]\nQE2[\"Q 125\u003Cbr/>Revenue: '50M'\"]\nend\n\n    subgraph Q2[\"Due Diligence Project B\"]\n        QE3[\"Q 456\u003Cbr/>Company Address: '123 Main St'\"]\n        QE4[\"Q 458\u003Cbr/>Industry: 'Technology'\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph CM[\"ContentMap: Vendor Profile\"]\n        direction TB\n        P1[\"Q 123 → /company/name\"]\n        P2[\"Q 125 → /financial/revenue\"]\n        P3[\"Q 456 → /company/address\"]\n        P4[\"Q 458 → /company/industry\"]\n    end\n\n\n    subgraph CD[\"Content Document\"]\n        direction TB\n        JSON[\"Populated Content\u003Cbr/>{\u003Cbr/>  'company': {\u003Cbr/>    'name': 'Acme Corp',\u003Cbr/>    'address': '123 Main St',\u003Cbr/>    'industry': 'Technology'\u003Cbr/>  },\u003Cbr/>  'financial': {\u003Cbr/>    'revenue': '50M'\u003Cbr/>  }\u003Cbr/>}\"]\n    end\n\n    QE1 --> P1\n    QE2 --> P2\n    QE3 --> P3\n    QE4 --> P4\n\n    P1 --> JSON\n    P2 --> JSON\n    P3 --> JSON\n    P4 --> JSON\n\n\n    style Q1 fill:#e1f5ff\n    style Q2 fill:#e1f5ff\n    style CD fill:#e8f5e9\n\n```\n\n### Generate and Update Documents\n\nOnce connections are established, Fluvial can automatically create documents from questionnaire responses. When source information changes, you can choose to update the documents automatically or review changes before approving them. The system keeps track of what changed, when, and why.\n\n### Share in Any Format\n\nWhile Fluvial stores document data in a structured way, you can output documents in whatever format you need—PDF for distribution, HTML for web viewing, or data feeds for other systems. Your branding and formatting preferences are maintained in customizable templates.\n\n## Building Organisational Knowledge\n\nBeyond individual projects, Fluvial helps you build a reference library of information that grows more valuable over time. Organise documents by the entities they describe (vendors, regions, industries), control who can access what information, and track how documents evolve. Every assessment you conduct can contribute to your organisation's collective knowledge.\n\n## Real-World Example\n\n**Advisory Firm Building Vendor Intelligence**\n\nAn advisory firm conducts vendor evaluations for clients. Rather than treating each project as isolated work, they use Fluvial to build a proprietary database of vendor information.\n\nFirst, they create a standard vendor profile template that captures capabilities, certifications, performance history, and risk factors. When conducting a client assessment, questionnaire responses automatically populate these profiles. As they complete more projects, their vendor database grows and becomes more comprehensive.\n\nFor subsequent client engagements, they can reference existing vendor intelligence while keeping client-specific details confidential. Each project enhances their institutional knowledge, enabling faster, more informed recommendations. The complete audit trail also demonstrates to clients exactly how assessments were conducted and conclusions were reached.\n\nVisit our [Solutions](/solutions/) to see how document automation applies to specific industries and use cases.\n\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\nDocuments can move through approval processes with whatever stages you need, e.g. draft, review, approved, and published. Set up requirements for legal or compliance sign-off before documents are finalised, and trigger notifications or system updates when documents reach certain milestones. These [workflows](/features/workflow) can be customised using a [GUI workflow builder](/features/workflow) and simple expression language policies.\n\n::: details Expression Language for Workflow Control\nControl workflow transitions using flexible business rules with Common Expression Language (CEL):\n\n```javascript\n// Allow access to vendor profiles for users in procurement or legal\nuser.roles.contains(\"procurement\") || user.roles.contains(\"legal\")\n\n// Restrict sensitive financial data to senior analysts\nentity.data_classification == \"financial\" && user.seniority >= \"senior\"\n\n// Organisation-based access control\nentity.author_org_id == user.org.id\n\n// Time-based restrictions\nnow.getHours() >= 9 && now.getHours() \u003C 17\n```\n\nThese expressions determine who can view, edit, or approve documents, and under what conditions workflow transitions can occur.\n:::\n\n## What Makes Fluvial Different\n\nMost questionnaire platforms only offer basic export features. You get a PDF or spreadsheet, but then you're on your own to create the documents you actually need.\n\nFluvial maintains living connections between your source data and final documents. Information can be updated, mappings can be reused across projects, and you have a complete record of how each document was created and modified.

Instead of being locked into fixed, predetermined steps, you can create workflows that match your specific operational requirements.\n:::\n\n\n\nFluvial's approval-gated workflow system addresses a critical gap in most workflow solutions. While many platforms offer basic status tracking, few provide the granular approval controls required in regulated environments.\n\nFluvia provides the ability to:\n- Track individual approvals against specific entities\n- Gate transitions based on approval status\n- Maintain detailed audit trails of who approved what and when\n- Configure complex, multi-tier approval requirements\n- Write business logic in human-readable guard expressions\n- Coordinate workflows across nested entity hierarchies\n\n\n::: danger Configuration vs. Logic Revolution\n**Traditional Systems:** Endless configuration screens, rigid rules, project-specific settings that multiply complexity.\n\n**Fluvial's Approach:** Write business logic directly in readable expressions that capture your organization's intent without technical complexity.\n\n```\n// Replace dozens of configuration options with one clear rule\nuser.department == 'legal' and approval.risk_assessment \u003C= 'medium' \n  or user.role == 'managing_partner'\n```\nInstead of being locked into fixed, predetermined steps, you can create workflows that match your specific operational requirements.\n:::\n\n## What Are Workflows?\n\nA workflow defines the lifecycle of business objects in your organisation - such as projects, issues, or procurement processes. Each workflow consists of:\n\n- **Statuses** - The different stages an item can be in (e.g., \"Draft\", \"Under Review\", \"Published\", \"Closed\")\n- **Transitions** - The allowed movements between statuses (e.g., moving from \"Draft\" to \"Under Review\")\n- **Actions** - What users can do at each status (e.g., edit details, approve, reject, publish)\n\n## Benefits\n\n### Organisational Flexibility\nDifferent organisations have different processes. Fluvial workflows adapt to your existing business rules rather than forcing you to change how you work.\n\n### Version Control\nWorkflows are versioned, allowing you to evolve your processes over time while maintaining historical consistency for existing projects.\n\n### Permission Integration\nEach status defines exactly what actions users can perform, ensuring proper governance and access control throughout your processes.\n\n### Advanced Approval Controls\n::: warning Key Differentiator\nFluvial's unique approval system allows workflows to require specific individuals or roles to formally approve items before transitions can occur. This approval-gated workflow capability is essential for regulated environments and often missing from competitor solutions.\n:::\n\n### Customisable Business Logic\nAdvanced users can define custom rules that determine when transitions are allowed and what happens during status changes.\n\n## How Workflows Work\n\n### Status-Based Permissions\nAt any given status, users only see the actions they're permitted to perform. \n\n::: info Permission Examples\n- **Draft** status: Authors can edit, save, or submit for review\n- **Under Review** status: Reviewers can approve, reject, or request changes\n- **Published** status: Limited users can archive or create amendments\n:::\n\n### Controlled Transitions\nMoving between statuses is controlled and auditable. Users can only make transitions that are explicitly defined and for which they have permission.\n\n### Approval-Gated Transitions\n::: tip Smart Transition Control\nWorkflows can require formal approvals before allowing critical transitions. The system tracks who has approved what, and transition rules can verify that required approvals are in place before proceeding.\n:::\n\n### Guard Expressions - Business Logic in Readable form\n\nFluvial uses \"CEL\" (Common Expression Language), a readable and industry-standard expression language that lets you write complex business rules without programming. Instead of endless configuration screens, you write logical conditions that are simple to understand and maintain.\n\n\n**Access Control Example:**\n```\nuser.roles contains 'admin' or resource.owner == user.id\n```\n\n**Data Filtering Example:**\n```\ncreated_at upcoming within 24 hours and status == 'pending'\n```\n\n**Workflow Conditions Example:**\n```\napproval.status == 'approved' and budget.remaining >= cost\n```\n\n::: info Why Guard Expressions Matter\nGuard expressions eliminate the configuration complexity that plagues other workflow systems. Instead of creating dozens of project-specific settings, you write readable business rules that capture your organization's logic directly.\n:::\n\n### Context-Aware Rules\nWorkflows can incorporate business rules that consider the current state of the project, user roles, deadlines, approval status, and other contextual factors.\n\n### Nested Workflow Scopes\n::: tip Hierarchical Business Logic\nFluvial supports nested workflow scopes where parent and child entities can have independent workflows that interact intelligently. A **Project** contains many **Responses**, each with their own workflow, but child workflows can trigger parent transitions when guard conditions are met.\n:::\n\n**Example: Coordinated Transition Logic**\n- Child **Response** workflows attempt to transition parent **Project** from \"Responding\" to \"Scoring\"\n- Parent transition only fires when guard condition is satisfied:\n\n```\nall_responses.status == 'submitted' and responses.count >= minimum_required\n```\n\n::: info Business Rule Achievement\nThis achieves the business rule *\"All responses shall be considered over the same period of time\"* without complex configuration - just readable logic that expresses your business intent.\n:::\n\n## Workflow Management\n\n### Creating Workflows\nAdministrators can create new workflows for different types of business processes.

Document the logical conditions that govern when transitions should occur\n4. **Write Guard Expressions** - Convert business rules into readable CEL expressions\n5. **Design Custom Workflows** - Use the workflow designer to create processes that match your requirements and approval gates\n6. **Configure Cross-Scope Logic** - Set up parent-child workflow coordination where needed\n7. **Test and Refine** - Validate new workflows with a small team before full deployment\n8. **Train Users** - Ensure your team understands the new processes, their roles, and approval responsibilities\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Approval Logic\n::: tip Advanced Approval Features\nDefine complex approval requirements such as:\n- Multiple approvals required from different roles\n- Escalation rules when approvals are overdue\n- Conditional approvals based on risk levels or content analysis\n- Sequential vs. parallel approval workflows\n:::\n\n### Business Rules Engine\n::: tip Readable Business Logic\nDefine custom business rules using the semi-technical **CEL** expression language. Control when transitions can occur based on project data, user attributes, approval status, external conditions, and business calendars - all without programming.\n:::\n\n**Example Rules:**\n```\n// Prevent weekend submissions\nsubmission_date.weekday not in ['saturday', 'sunday']\n\n// Require senior approval for large budgets  \nbudget.total > 100000 and approvals.any(seniority >= 'director')\n\n// Coordinate parent-child workflows\nchild_workflows.all(status in ['completed', 'approved'])\n```\n\n### Integration Capabilities\nWorkflows can trigger external system calls, send notifications, update dashboards, and integrate with other business applications when approvals are received or transitions occur.\n\n### Audit and Compliance Reporting\nComplete audit trails show:\n- How items move through workflows\n- Who provided approvals and when\n- Any approval exceptions or escalations\n- Full compliance history for regulatory requirements\n\n### Multi-Organisation Support\nLarge enterprises can define different workflows for different business units while maintaining consistent approval standards and governance requirements across the organisation.\n\n## Competitive Advantage\n\n::: warning Critical Market Gap\nFluvial's approval-gated workflow system addresses a critical gap in most workflow solutions.

Services Compliance","KYC/AML compliance with risk-scored questionnaires, gated approvals, audit-ready documentation, and integrations for automated regulatory reporting.","Financial institutions operate under extensive regulatory oversight requiring systematic assessment of counterparty risk, operational controls, and regulatory capital adequacy. Compliance teams must conduct ongoing assessments while maintaining documentation suitable for regulatory examination.\n\n## The Financial Compliance Challenge\n\nRegulatory requirements demand that financial institutions assess customer risk (KYC), monitor for money laundering (AML), evaluate operational resilience, and calculate regulatory capital requirements. These assessments involve complex scoring methodologies, multi-tier approval requirements, and extensive documentation that regulators expect to review during examinations.\n\n## How Fluvial Supports Financial Compliance\n\n### Risk Assessment Frameworks\n\nFluvial's [questionnaire capabilities](/features/questionnaire) implement regulatory assessment frameworks with multi-dimensional scoring and weighting. KYC questionnaires use weighted questions to calculate customer risk ratings, determining monitoring requirements and approval levels. AML assessments incorporate both quantitative thresholds and qualitative risk factors, producing composite risk scores that drive compliance decisions.\n\n### Regulatory Approval Requirements\n\nFinancial compliance often requires documented approvals from compliance officers, legal counsel, and senior management. The [workflow system](/features/workflow) enforces these approval gates, preventing customer onboarding or transaction execution until required approvals are obtained. CEL guard expressions ensure high-risk relationships receive appropriate executive review before approval.\n\n### Compliance Documentation\n\nRegulatory examinations require comprehensive documentation showing assessment methodology, risk classification logic, and approval decisions. [document automation](/features/document-management) transforms assessment data into compliance reports, customer risk profiles, and regulatory submissions. Audit trails demonstrate exactly how customer risk ratings were determined and who approved high-risk relationships.\n\n### Regulatory Reporting Integration\n\n[API integration](/features/integration) enables automated regulatory reporting. Compliance assessment data feeds directly into regulatory reporting systems, eliminating manual compilation of examination responses.

Fluvial provides a comprehensive platform for assessing, monitoring, and managing these relationships throughout their lifecycle.\n\n## The TPRM Challenge\n\nThird-party risk management extends beyond initial vendor selection. Organizations must continuously assess vendor security posture, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and operational capabilities while maintaining audit trails that satisfy regulatory requirements. This ongoing assessment generates substantial documentation that must be maintained, updated, and made available for review.\n\n## How Fluvial Addresses TPRM Requirements\n\n### Comprehensive Vendor Assessment\n\nFluvial's [questionnaire management system](/features/questionnaire) supports multi-dimensional vendor evaluations covering security, compliance, financial stability, and operational capabilities. Hierarchical question organization allows assessment frameworks to mirror regulatory standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR) while weighted scoring provides risk-based vendor classification.\n\n### Approval-Gated Review Processes\n\nThe [workflow system](/features/workflow) enforces multi-tier review requirements common in TPRM programs. Security teams review technical controls, legal teams verify contractual protections, and risk committees approve high-risk vendor relationships. CEL-based guard expressions ensure vendors cannot be onboarded until all required approvals are obtained and risk thresholds are met.\n\n### Vendor Profile Documentation\n\n[Structured document automation](/features/document-management) transforms assessment responses into maintained vendor profiles. Security questionnaire responses populate vendor risk profiles that serve as reference documentation across the organization. When vendors undergo reassessment, mappings update existing profiles while JSON Patch audit trails preserve the complete history of risk rating changes.\n\n### Continuous Monitoring Integration\n\n[API integration](/features/integration) enables real-time updates from external risk intelligence sources. Webhook notifications alert risk teams when vendor security incidents occur, financial ratings change, or compliance certifications expire. Webhook-driven automation can automatically trigger reassessment workflows when vendor risk profiles change materially.\n\n## Key Capabilities for TPRM\n\n**Vendor Lifecycle Management** - From initial assessment through ongoing monitoring to off-boarding, workflows track vendor status and ensure periodic reassessment occurs on schedule.\n\n**Risk-Based Classification** - Weighted scoring automatically categorizes vendors into risk tiers, determining reassessment frequency and approval requirements.\n\n**Regulatory Audit Support** - Complete audit trails demonstrate vendor assessment rigor, approval documentation, and continuous monitoring compliance for regulatory examinations.\n\n**Reference Data Accumulation** - Organizations build proprietary vendor intelligence databases, with each assessment enriching institutional knowledge about vendor capabilities and risks.\n\n## Typical TPRM Workflow\n\nA vendor progresses from initial assessment through security review, legal evaluation, and risk committee approval. High-risk vendors require additional executive sign-off before onboarding. Once approved, the vendor profile enters continuous monitoring status, with automated alerts triggering reassessment when risk indicators change.\n\nThroughout this lifecycle, every assessment, approval decision, and risk rating change is documented with complete audit trails suitable for regulatory examination.\n\n---\n\nFluvial transforms third-party risk management from a compliance exercise into a systematic risk intelligence capability, providing organizations with comprehensive vendor visibility while maintaining the rigorous controls required in regulated environments.","src/content/solutions/tprm.md","e2210317f0602c8a",{"html":2993,"metadata":2994},"\u003Cp>Organizations increasingly rely on external vendors, suppliers, and service providers, creating complex webs of third-party relationships that introduce operational, security, and compliance risks.

Whether managing clinical trials, FDA submissions, or supplier qualifications, these organizations need rigorous assessment processes with comprehensive documentation.\n\n## The Healthcare Compliance Challenge\n\nHealthcare compliance spans clinical trial protocols, FDA submission requirements, patient safety standards, quality management systems, and supply chain integrity. Each area involves specialized regulatory requirements, and documentation must demonstrate systematic compliance verification suitable for FDA inspections or regulatory audits.\n\n## How Fluvial Supports Healthcare Compliance\n\n### Regulatory Assessment Frameworks\n\nFluvial's [questionnaire capabilities](/features/questionnaire) structure compliance verification around regulatory frameworks. Clinical trial assessments mirror FDA requirements, ensuring protocol evaluations address all required safety and efficacy considerations. Quality management audits follow ISO 13485 structure, organizing questions hierarchically to match standard requirements.\n\n### Multi-Tier Review and Approval\n\nHealthcare compliance often requires review by clinical experts, quality assurance professionals, and regulatory specialists. The [workflow system](/features/workflow) coordinates this review, ensuring clinical trial protocols receive appropriate medical review, quality audits are validated by QA professionals, and regulatory submissions are approved by regulatory affairs before filing.\n\n### Compliance Documentation\n\nRegulatory submissions require extensive supporting documentation. [document automation](/features/document-management) transforms compliance assessments into FDA submission documents, quality audit reports, and regulatory filing schedules. Persistent mappings ensure that when compliance verification data is updated, dependent regulatory documents reflect current information while maintaining audit trails of all changes.\n\n### Regulatory System Integration\n\n[API integration](/features/integration) connects compliance processes to clinical trial management systems, quality management platforms, and regulatory submission tools. When compliance assessments identify issues, webhook notifications alert relevant teams and update tracking systems. FDA submission workflows can automatically package required assessment documentation for regulatory filing.\n\n## Key Capabilities for Healthcare\n\n**Protocol Compliance Verification** - Clinical trial assessments systematically verify protocol adherence, with approval workflows ensuring appropriate medical and regulatory review before trial progression.\n\n**Quality System Audits** - Supplier and internal quality audits follow structured frameworks with documented corrective action workflows when deficiencies are identified.\n\n**Regulatory Submission Support** - Compliance assessment data populates regulatory submission documents with complete audit trails demonstrating verification methodology.\n\n**Supply Chain Qualification** - Supplier qualification assessments verify regulatory compliance, quality system adequacy, and capability to meet pharmaceutical or medical device standards.\n\n## Typical Healthcare Compliance Workflow\n\nA clinical trial protocol undergoes systematic assessment against FDA requirements, with medical reviewers verifying clinical appropriateness and regulatory specialists confirming regulatory compliance. Required approvals from institutional review boards and regulatory affairs are documented before trial initiation.\n\nThroughout the trial, ongoing compliance assessments verify protocol adherence, with any deviations triggering corrective action workflows and regulatory reporting requirements. All compliance verification activities maintain audit trails suitable for FDA inspection.\n\n---\n\nFluvial provides healthcare organizations with the structured compliance frameworks, multi-expert review coordination, and regulatory documentation capabilities required to meet stringent healthcare regulatory requirements.","src/content/solutions/healthcare.md","b888972a69c048df",{"html":3034,"metadata":3035},"\u003Cp>Healthcare and life sciences organizations navigate complex regulatory frameworks requiring systematic compliance verification, quality management, and supply chain validation.
