We build them to help you do your best work. There are millions of people using Lexington products every day. Because we don’t know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.\n\nWhen we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to [Lexington LLC](#_). We spun off Highrise HQ, LLC in the past, but it has since rejoined Lexington LLC.\n\nWhen we say “Services”, we mean our websites, including Lexington.com, hey.com, and Lexington.com, and any product created and maintained by Lexington LLC. That includes Lexington (all versions), HEY, Highrise, Campfire, Backpack, Ta-da List, and Writeboard, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.\n\nWhen we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organisations that own an account with one or more of our Services. We have specific ownership policies for our products: [Lexington 4](#_), [Lexington 2](#_), [Lexington Classic](#_), [HEY for Domains](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_) and [Backpack](#_).\n\nWe may update these Terms of Service (\"Terms\") in the future. You can track all changes made since mid-2018 [on GitHub](#_). Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.\n\nWhen you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. **These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**\n\nIf you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about [who we are](#_), [how we work](#_), and keeping an open door to [your feedback](#_).\n\nAccount Terms\n-------------\n\n1.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend all users set up [two-factor authentication](#_) for added security. In some of our Services, we may require it.\n2.  You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Use Restrictions policy](#_), and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.\n3.  You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.\n4.  You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.\n\nPayment, Refunds, and Plan Changes\n----------------------------------\n\n1.  If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.\n2.  For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation. See our [Cancellation policy](#_) for more details.\n3.  If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.\n4.  All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. See our [Taxes policy](#_) for more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.\n5.  We process refunds according to our [Fair Refund policy](#_).\n\nCancellation and Termination\n----------------------------\n\n1.  You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our [Cancellation policy](#_). An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always [contact our Support team](#_).\n2.  All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted. If you want to export any data before your account is canceled, we‘ve provided instructions for [HEY](#_), [Lexington 4](#_), [Lexington 2](#_), [Lexington Classic](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_), and [Backpack](#_).\n3.  If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing cycle. See our [Fair Refund policy](#_) for more details.\n4.  We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](#_).\n5.  Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.\n\nModifications to the Service and Prices\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  We make a promise to our customers to support our Services [until the end of the Internet](#_). That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.\n2.  Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.\n\nUptime, Security, and Privacy\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services — here’s [the one exception](#_) — but do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit [https://www.37status.com](#_) to see the status of our Services.\n2.  We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.\n3.  We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to our [Security Overview](#_) for full details and our [Security Response page](#_) for how to report a security incident or threat.\n4.  When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Lexington may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](#_) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:\n\n    *   **To help you with support requests you make.** We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.\n    *   **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.\n    *   **To safeguard Lexington.** We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an [abuse report investigation](#_).\n    *   **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-US authority approaches Lexington for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Lexington is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.\n5.  We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for [Lexington](#_), [HEY](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_), and [Backpack](#_), as well as a list of [Company processors](#_).\n\n6.  Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Lexington is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms, the [Privacy policy](#_), and [other policies](#_). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use Lexington’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.\n7.  These Terms incorporate the [Lexington Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)](#_) when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) applies to your use of Lexington Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA linked above supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and Lexington LLC relating to your use of the Lexington Services.\n\nCopyright and Content Ownership\n-------------------------------\n\n1.  All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law. We provide details on [how to file a copyright infringement claim](#_).\n2.  You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.\n3.  We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.\n4.  The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company’s logos or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [email us](#_) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any permissions if you violate these Terms.\n5.  You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.\n\nFeatures and Bugs\n-----------------\n\nWe design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.\n\nWe also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.\n\nServices Adaptations and API Terms\n----------------------------------\n\nWe offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our Services (currently Lexington, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack). Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:\n\n1.  You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.\n2.  Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user’s activity _other than time tracking_, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.\n3.  Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account’s access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.\n\nSome third-party providers have created integrations between our Services and theirs. You can find some of those integrations for Lexington at [https://Lexington.com/extras](#_) and for Highrise at [https://highrisehq.com/extras](#_). We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.\n\nLiability\n---------\n\nWe mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:\n\n**_You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability._**\n\nIn other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general [giving a damn](#_). If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.\n\nIf you have a question about any of these Terms, please [contact our Support team](#_).","src/content/infopages/terms.md","2af8e0bab6ce6cfd",{"html":320,"metadata":321},"\u003Ch2 id=\"all-the-terms-that-you-agree-to-when-you-sign-up-for-a-lexington-product\">All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Lexington product.\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>From everyone at Lexington, thank you for using our products!

A decade later, the financial-services regulators had their say, and “Third-Party Risk Management” (TPRM) was born. What began as a series of spreadsheets and checklists has since evolved into a core discipline — one that sits somewhere between compliance, security and supply-chain governance.\r\n\r\n## The long road from sourcing to stewardship\r\n\r\nIn the mid-2000s, most due-diligence exercises were episodic. A supplier was vetted once, approved, and then rarely looked at again. By the early 2010s, regulators such as the OCC and the FCA were warning that outsourcing did not transfer risk.

Due diligence was no longer just about asking the right questions — it was about understanding how data flowed through multiple layers of subcontractors, and about maintaining continuous oversight rather than annual reviews.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to today, and many organisations are trying to knit procurement and TPRM back together again. The old silos are inefficient; the new goal is a single “third-party lifecycle” that covers sourcing, contracting, monitoring and exit in one joined-up process. Consultants are increasingly asked to help clients not only assess risk but orchestrate the underlying data, documents and workflows that make assessments repeatable and auditable.\r\n\r\n## The next stage: orchestration, not administration\r\n\r\nThat shift brings us to the present moment — and to a change in expectations for the software that supports these processes. The first generation of TPRM tools focused on questionnaire distribution and scoring. The second added workflow and reporting. The third, now emerging, treats the assessment process itself as infrastructure — something to be embedded into wider enterprise systems.\r\n\r\nModern teams want assessments that trigger actions elsewhere: opening service-desk tickets, updating CRM records, generating contract clauses, feeding risk dashboards. They want document automation and content-management capabilities to reuse the evidence they already hold, and they want APIs rather than exports. In other words, they want the TPRM platform to act as a conductor, not a filing cabinet.\r\n\r\n## Enter the integration-first mindset\r\n\r\nThis is precisely where the new crop of tools is heading. Rather than locking logic inside proprietary workflows, integration-first systems expose everything through APIs and event streams. Webhooks broadcast assessment events in real time; guard expressions decide when those events should fire; data transforms shape payloads for whatever downstream system needs to listen.\r\n\r\nWe hope that Fluvial exemplifies the direction of travel. It was built originally for complex RFP and vendor-risk processes, but its API-first architecture means it can now serve as a generalised assessment engine. Every feature in its interface is mirrored in the API, allowing developers to create questionnaires, transition workflows or generate documents programmatically. Conditional logic based on CEL expressions lets integrations fire only when certain scores or approvals occur, while webhook payloads can be transformed on the fly to suit external schemas.\r\n\r\nTo the consultant’s ear, that matters less for its technical neatness than for what it enables in practice: truly automated due diligence chains. A supplier finishes an assessment; a webhook updates the risk register; another triggers contract generation; the signed document lands automatically in the compliance archive. No swivel-chair integration, no human relay.\r\n\r\n## Beyond TPRM: towards unified assurance\r\n\r\nThe bigger story, though, is that this architecture is not limited to vendor risk. The same pattern applies to ESG disclosures, product safety attestations, internal control surveys — any process that gathers structured information, routes it for approval and turns it into reusable evidence. As assurance functions converge, clients will expect a single engine capable of supporting them all.\r\n\r\nThat puts consultants in an interesting position. Their expertise in risk frameworks and regulatory interpretation remains indispensable, but now it can be multiplied through automation rather than manual oversight. Platforms like Fluvial simply provide the connective tissue — a way to embed that expertise directly into clients’ operational systems.\r\n\r\n## Looking ahead\r\n\r\nIf the last two decades were about building TPRM as a standalone discipline, the next will be about dissolving the boundaries again — integrating risk thinking into the everyday machinery of procurement, finance and compliance. The technology is catching up with that ambition: open, event-driven and extensible rather than locked into fixed templates.\r\n\r\nSo the story comes full circle.

The price of reliability was rigidity: software worked because it was predictable, and it was predictable because users had very little room to change it.  \r\n\r\nThat bargain is beginning to shift.  With the rise of generative and “agentic” AI, ordinary users can now *instruct* computers rather than merely *use* them.  The line between configuration and programming is blurring, and systems that embrace this shift will feel less like locked boxes and more like collaborators.  \r\n\r\n### From low-code to language models  \r\n\r\nThe last decade’s answer to flexibility was the “low-code” platform.  It promised drag-and-drop logic for non-developers — a commendable idea, but one that often produced fragile, opaque systems.  Low-code tools moved complexity from syntax to interface, not away altogether.  \r\n\r\nLarge Language Models change the equation.  Instead of hiding code behind diagrams, they allow code to be generated, explained and modified in ordinary language.  A non-programmer can now ask an AI assistant to “route high-risk vendors to the legal team if the score is under 60”, and receive a functioning snippet of policy logic in response.  The machine writes the expression; the human verifies intent.  \r\n\r\nWhat emerges is a new balance of labour: humans supply context and judgement, AI handles translation and syntax.  \r\n\r\n### The waterbed theory of complexity  \r\n\r\nFluvial’s design starts from an unglamorous truth: complexity never disappears, it only moves.  Push it down in one place and it bulges up in another — like a waterbed.  Traditional enterprise systems bury complexity inside configuration screens and boolean switches.  They are “simple” only in the sense that the user cannot see the machinery.  \r\n\r\nFluvial takes the opposite approach.  It exposes control through a compact, well-defined expression language — **CEL** — at key decision points: who can view what, when a workflow advances, how scores are calculated, what triggers an integration.  That makes the platform honest about where complexity lives.  You can bend the rules, but you can also see them.  \r\n\r\nUntil recently, such openness would have been intimidating.  Writing expressions, even short ones, demanded technical skill and documentation.  The difference now is that generative AI can shoulder that work.  The user can ask, “write a CEL rule that blocks approval unless both finance and security have signed off”, and the system (or a connected assistant) can supply it instantly.  The result is still human-legible, still auditable, but far less forbidding.  \r\n\r\n### Designing for an AI-assisted world  \r\n\r\nBuilding systems that genuinely benefit from AI requires more than grafting a chatbot onto the front end.  A few architectural principles make the difference:  \r\n\r\n1. **Everything addressable by API** – AI agents need real interfaces, not simulated clicks.  An API-first platform lets an agent read, write and orchestrate safely.  \r\n2. **Expression points, not configuration forests** – give AI concise, declarative surfaces to work with.  Expression languages such as CEL are perfect for this: bounded in scope, strongly typed, and easy to audit.  \r\n3. **Clear semantics and documentation** – the model must understand what each endpoint and field *means*; ambiguity breeds errors.  OpenAPI definitions and JSON Schemas provide that clarity.  \r\n4. **Security boundaries** – when AI gains the ability to act, not just advise, permissions and logging become essential.  Every agent call should be as accountable as a human one.  \r\n5. **Composable automation** – event systems and webhooks allow AI components to fit into existing workflows rather than replace them wholesale.  \r\n\r\nFluvial’s integration architecture was built with these ideas from the outset.  Because every capability is API-exposed and every decision point can be controlled through CEL, the system is inherently “AI-ready”.  An agent can read a questionnaire, analyse responses, draft policies, or trigger next-stage workflows without human re-keying.  Yet humans remain firmly in charge of logic and oversight.  \r\n\r\n### Collaboration, not delegation  \r\n\r\nThe deeper opportunity here is cultural rather than technical.  As AI systems become collaborators, organisations must decide how much discretion to grant them and how to capture the reasoning behind automated decisions.  Expression languages help precisely because they make those decisions explicit.  Instead of a hidden neural model deciding what “high risk” means, a CEL rule states it plainly.  Transparency becomes the new usability.  \r\n\r\nIn this sense, AI doesn’t so much replace humans as *upgrade* them.  The compliance analyst who once clicked through configuration pages can now shape system behaviour directly, using natural language to generate rules that encode policy intent.  The computer executes; the human curates.  \r\n\r\n### Towards the next generation of enterprise tools  \r\n\r\nIf the 2010s were about workflow automation, the 2020s will be about *behavioural customisation* — software that can be taught, not merely configured.  The winners will be systems that strike the right balance between expressiveness and safety: open enough for AI to act, disciplined enough for humans to trust.  \r\n\r\nFluvial’s choice to embed CEL rather than a full programming language reflects that balance.  It avoids turning the platform into a spaghetti of toggles, but it also respects the complexity of real-world governance.  AI simply makes that trade-off workable at last, by generating and explaining the rules that would once have required a specialist.  \r\n\r\nThe result is a quieter revolution: not computers replacing people, but people finally able to speak to computers in their own language — and be understood.","src/content/posts/2.md",[923],"/src/images/blog/10.jpg","34902bb090bbe6f8",{"html":926,"metadata":927},"\u003Cp>—\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"when-the-computer-stops-being-the-bottleneck-ai-customisation-and-the-new-division-of-labour\">When the Computer Stops Being the Bottleneck: AI, Customisation, and the New Division of Labour\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>For half a century we have trained people to adapt to computers.\u003Cbr>\nWe clicked where the system allowed, filled in the fields provided, and accepted configuration menus as the limits of what could be done.

A non-programmer can now ask an AI assistant to “route high-risk vendors to the legal team if the score is under 60”, and receive a functioning snippet of policy logic in response.  The machine writes the expression; the human verifies intent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What emerges is a new balance of labour: humans supply context and judgement, AI handles translation and syntax.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-waterbed-theory-of-complexity\">The waterbed theory of complexity\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Fluvial’s design starts from an unglamorous truth: complexity never disappears, it only moves.  Push it down in one place and it bulges up in another — like a waterbed.  Traditional enterprise systems bury complexity inside configuration screens and boolean switches.  They are “simple” only in the sense that the user cannot see the machinery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fluvial takes the opposite approach.  It exposes control through a compact, well-defined expression language — \u003Cstrong>CEL\u003C/strong> — at key decision points: who can view what, when a workflow advances, how scores are calculated, what triggers an integration.  That makes the platform honest about where complexity lives.  You can bend the rules, but you can also see them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Until recently, such openness would have been intimidating.  Writing expressions, even short ones, demanded technical skill and documentation.  The difference now is that generative AI can shoulder that work.  The user can ask, “write a CEL rule that blocks approval unless both finance and security have signed off”, and the system (or a connected assistant) can supply it instantly.  The result is still human-legible, still auditable, but far less forbidding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"designing-for-an-ai-assisted-world\">Designing for an AI-assisted world\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Building systems that genuinely benefit from AI requires more than grafting a chatbot onto the front end.  A few architectural principles make the difference:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Everything addressable by API\u003C/strong> – AI agents need real interfaces, not simulated clicks.  An API-first platform lets an agent read, write and orchestrate safely.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Expression points, not configuration forests\u003C/strong> – give AI concise, declarative surfaces to work with.  Expression languages such as CEL are perfect for this: bounded in scope, strongly typed, and easy to audit.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Clear semantics and documentation\u003C/strong> – the model must understand what each endpoint and field \u003Cem>means\u003C/em>; ambiguity breeds errors.  OpenAPI definitions and JSON Schemas provide that clarity.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Security boundaries\u003C/strong> – when AI gains the ability to act, not just advise, permissions and logging become essential.  Every agent call should be as accountable as a human one.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Composable automation\u003C/strong> – event systems and webhooks allow AI components to fit into existing workflows rather than replace them wholesale.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Fluvial’s integration architecture was built with these ideas from the outset.  Because every capability is API-exposed and every decision point can be controlled through CEL, the system is inherently “AI-ready”.  An agent can read a questionnaire, analyse responses, draft policies, or trigger next-stage workflows without human re-keying.  Yet humans remain firmly in charge of logic and oversight.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"collaboration-not-delegation\">Collaboration, not delegation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The deeper opportunity here is cultural rather than technical.  As AI systems become collaborators, organisations must decide how much discretion to grant them and how to capture the reasoning behind automated decisions.  Expression languages help precisely because they make those decisions explicit.  Instead of a hidden neural model deciding what “high risk” means, a CEL rule states it plainly.  Transparency becomes the new usability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this sense, AI doesn’t so much replace humans as \u003Cem>upgrade\u003C/em> them.  The compliance analyst who once clicked through configuration pages can now shape system behaviour directly, using natural language to generate rules that encode policy intent.  The computer executes; the human curates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"towards-the-next-generation-of-enterprise-tools\">Towards the next generation of enterprise tools\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>If the 2010s were about workflow automation, the 2020s will be about \u003Cem>behavioural customisation\u003C/em> — software that can be taught, not merely configured.  The winners will be systems that strike the right balance between expressiveness and safety: open enough for AI to act, disciplined enough for humans to trust.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fluvial’s choice to embed CEL rather than a full programming language reflects that balance.  It avoids turning the platform into a spaghetti of toggles, but it also respects the complexity of real-world governance.  AI simply makes that trade-off workable at last, by generating and explaining the rules that would once have required a specialist.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The result is a quieter revolution: not computers replacing people, but people finally able to speak to computers in their own language — and be understood.\u003C/p>",{"headings":928,"localImagePaths":947,"remoteImagePaths":948,"frontmatter":949,"imagePaths":953},[929,932,935,938,941,944],{"depth":260,"slug":930,"text":931},"when-the-computer-stops-being-the-bottleneck-ai-customisation-and-the-new-division-of-labour","When the Computer Stops Being the Bottleneck: AI, Customisation, and the New Division of Labour",{"depth":454,"slug":933,"text":934},"from-low-code-to-language-models","From low-code to language models",{"depth":454,"slug":936,"text":937},"the-waterbed-theory-of-complexity","The waterbed theory of complexity",{"depth":454,"slug":939,"text":940},"designing-for-an-ai-assisted-world","Designing for an AI-assisted world",{"depth":454,"slug":942,"text":943},"collaboration-not-delegation","Collaboration, not delegation",{"depth":454,"slug":945,"text":946},"towards-the-next-generation-of-enterprise-tools","Towards the next generation of enterprise tools",[],[],{"pubDate":950,"team":914,"title":911,"description":913,"image":951,"tags":952},["Date","2025-10-15T00:00:00.000Z"],{"url":923,"alt":917},[919],[],{"id":472,"data":955,"body":964,"filePath":965,"assetImports":966,"digest":968,"rendered":969,"legacyId":524},{"title":956,"pubDate":957,"description":958,"team":914,"image":959,"tags":962},"The Age of Connected Assurance - Why Integration Matters More Than Ever",["Date","2025-10-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"As risk data multiplies, integration—not lock-in—defines the new assurance ecosystem.

The real problem is the opposite: too much data, scattered across too many systems.  Cyber-risk ratings from one provider, sanctions checks from another, ESG attestations, audit findings, self-assessments — each with its own portal, its own format, and its own login.  \n\nIt is no wonder that risk teams spend as much time *collecting* data as analysing it.  Integration has quietly become the defining challenge of modern assurance work.  \n\n### From standalone tools to connected ecosystems  \n\nA decade ago, a vendor-risk platform could get by as a self-contained application: you issued questionnaires, collected responses, and produced a report.  But the world has moved on.  The best insights now depend on data feeds drawn from specialist providers — threat-intelligence firms, continuous-monitoring services, vulnerability scanners, and regulatory databases.  \n\nThese external feeds are invaluable, but they introduce a subtle trap.  Many platforms integrate them through proprietary connectors or exclusive partnerships, effectively locking customers into a single data ecosystem.  That may seem convenient at first, but it soon limits flexibility and drives up cost.  The moment you want to swap providers, you discover that “integration” really meant “dependency”.  \n\nThe answer is to treat integration not as a product feature but as a design principle: everything should connect, and nothing should assume exclusivity.  \n\n### The rise of integration-as-infrastructure  \n\nTools like **n8n**, **Zapier**, and their predecessors such as **Twilio** taught the world an important lesson: automation doesn’t need to live inside the application.  It belongs at the seams — the places where data moves between systems.  These platforms succeeded because they spoke in open, predictable formats: HTTP, JSON, and webhooks rather than proprietary SDKs.  \n\nIn the assurance and due-diligence space, the same principle now applies.  The most valuable systems are those that *expect* to share their data.  They provide clear APIs, publish OpenAPI specifications, and emit well-structured events that downstream systems can consume.  When that foundation exists, AI tools can sit comfortably on top, orchestrating flows and generating logic as required.  \n\n### AI as the new integrator  \n\nThis is where generative and agentic AI systems are quietly changing the integration story.  Instead of hand-coding scripts or dragging boxes around in a workflow editor, users can describe what they want to happen in plain English — and let an AI produce the glue code.  \n\n“Whenever a vendor’s cyber-risk score falls below 600, open a ticket in Jira and notify compliance.”  \nThat’s no longer a developer’s task; it’s a prompt.  \n\nCombine that capability with a clear expression language such as **CEL**, and you have a controlled, auditable way to let AI generate integrations safely.  CEL provides the guardrails: deterministic logic, strong typing, and transparency.  The AI can propose; the human can review and adjust.  \n\n### Fluvial’s approach: flexible, not fragile  \n\nFluvial Diligence was designed around precisely this philosophy.  Every capability — questionnaire management, workflow transitions, analytics, user permissions — is exposed through a comprehensive API.  Events are broadcast through webhooks with CEL guards and transforms, allowing external systems to react instantly to what happens inside Fluvial.  \n\nThat openness means you can bring in the *best* external data — whether from cyber-risk advisories, financial monitoring feeds, or your own internal systems — without being confined to a single vendor’s ecosystem.  Integration is a relationship, not a contract.  \n\nThe platform’s built-in document-automation layer closes the loop.  Captured data is no longer trapped inside dashboards; it is automatically turned into usable artefacts — reports, risk memos, approval forms — and distributed through your chosen channels or repositories.  Data that cannot be used is just storage.  Data that drives documents and decisions becomes knowledge.  \n\n### Avoiding the lock-in trap  \n\nLock-in rarely announces itself.  It starts with a convenient pre-built connector, a bundled data feed, or a proprietary “ecosystem”.  Over time, these conveniences become constraints.  When your workflows, scoring models, and dashboards depend on a single provider’s schema, even small changes become costly.  \n\nOpen architectures resist that fate.  They make every data source swappable and every process inspectable.  AI tools extend this further by translating between formats and automating transformations that once required middleware developers.  Expression policies in CEL give organisations confidence that those automations remain transparent and verifiable.  \n\n### Towards truly collaborative assurance  \n\nThe combination of **AI**, **expression-based policy**, and **flexible integration** is creating something new: systems that can evolve as fast as the data they ingest.  Instead of waiting for vendors to add connectors, teams can generate their own; instead of navigating endless configuration trees, they can describe desired behaviour and let AI implement it within guardrails.  \n\nThis approach turns the old procurement and risk-management model inside out.  The value now lies not in owning the data but in *using* it effectively — correlating, contextualising, and communicating it across the organisation.  Platforms that understand this shift, and give users both the freedom to integrate and the tools to document, will define the next generation of assurance infrastructure.  \n\nFluvial happens to be one of them: API-first, expression-driven, and designed for the AI world — but the principle extends far beyond any single product.

Our system provides the flexibility to handle everything from simple compliance checklists to complex multi-party due diligence exercises.\n\n### Question Building\nCreate flexible questions using multiple input types:\n- **Rich Text Fields** - Multi-line responses with formatting support and validation rules\n- **Multiple Choice Options** - Radio buttons and dropdown selections with automated scoring\n- **Checkboxes** - Boolean responses for compliance and verification requirements\n- **File Attachments** - Supporting documents, evidence, and supplementary materials\n- **Embedded Media** - Links to external resources, videos, and reference materials\n\n### Intelligent Question Organisation\n\u003CCallout type=\"warning\" title=\"Key Differentiator\">\nFluvial's hierarchical section system allows unlimited nesting of topics and subtopics, enabling you to mirror complex organisational structures and regulatory frameworks exactly as they exist in your business domain.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## Sophisticated Weighting and Scoring\n\n### Multi-Dimensional Scoring System\nUnlike basic survey tools that treat all questions equally, Fluvial provides flexible scoring capabilities:\n\n#### Flexible Weighting Strategies\n- **Question-Level Weights** -

Rather than operating as an isolated tool, Fluvial becomes the orchestration layer that connects due diligence, compliance, and assessment processes across your entire technology ecosystem.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n\n## API-First Design\n\nEvery feature in Fluvial's user interface is accessible through REST APIs. This includes questionnaire management, response collection, workflow control, analytics, and user administration.\n\n### OpenAPI Documentation\n\nAll APIs follow OpenAPI 3.1 specifications, providing interactive documentation and enabling automatic client library generation for different programming languages.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Create questionnaire and trigger workflow\nconst questionnaire = await fluvial.questionnaires.create({\n  title: \"Vendor Security Assessment\",\n  sections: vendorSections,\n  workflow: \"security-review\"\n});\n\nawait fluvial.workflows.transition(questionnaire.id, 'security-review', {\n  assignTo: 'security-team@company.com'\n});\n```\n\n## Webhook System\n\nFluvial sends HTTP notifications when events occur, such as response submissions, workflow transitions, or user actions. Webhooks can be configured to filter events by type, project, or content conditions.\n\n### Delivery Reliability\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Z as Fluvial\n    participant W as Webhook Endpoint\n    participant R as Retry Queue\n    \n    Z->>W: Event Notification\n    alt Success Response\n        W->>Z: 200 OK\n    else Failure Response\n        W->>Z: 4xx/5xx Error\n        Z->>R: Queue for Retry\n        R->>W: Retry with Backoff\n    end\n```\n\nFailed webhook deliveries are automatically retried with exponential backoff. Permanently failed events are captured for review, and all deliveries include cryptographic signatures for verification.\n\n## Workflow Automation\n\nWebhooks can trigger external automation when questionnaires transition between workflow statuses. The webhook payload includes response data, scores, and context that receiving systems can use to execute business logic.\n\n**Example Webhook Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"event\": \"workflow.transition\",\n  \"questionnaire_id\": \"q_12345\",\n  \"from_status\": \"security-review\",\n  \"to_status\": \"approved\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"overall\": 85,\n    \"security\": 90,\n    \"compliance\": 80\n  },\n  \"responses\": { /* response data */ },\n  \"user\": { /* user context */ },\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-17T10:30:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Conditional Execution with CEL\n\nWebhook delivery can be controlled using Common Expression Language (CEL) guard expressions:\n\n```javascript\n// Only trigger for high-risk assessments\nscores.overall \u003C 50\n\n// Trigger for specific workflow transitions\ntransition.to == 'approved' && scores.security > 75\n\n// Complex conditional logic\nrisk_level == 'high' && department == 'finance' && approval_count \u003C 2\n```\n\n### Data Transformation\n\nCEL expressions can also transform webhook payloads before delivery, allowing you to extract specific fields, calculate derived values, or format data for external systems:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  'vendor_id': questionnaire.vendor_id,\n  'risk_score': scores.overall,\n  'status': transition.to,\n  'requires_review': scores.overall \u003C 60,\n  '\n}\n```\n\nThis approach keeps business logic in your systems rather than locked in platform configuration. Automation can be implemented in any language that handles HTTP requests, tested independently, and scaled separately from the questionnaire platform.\n\n## Enterprise System Integration\n\n### CRM and ERP Systems\n\nFluvial can integrate with customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems to automate vendor creation, update risk profiles, and trigger due diligence workflows.\n\n**Webhook-Based Salesforce Example:**\n\nConfigure a webhook with a CEL transformation expression to map Fluvial event data to Salesforce's expected format:\n\n```javascript\n// CEL transform expression for Salesforce opportunity update\n{\n  'opportunity_id': questionnaire.opportunity_id,\n  'fields': {\n    'Due_Diligence_Score__c': scores.overall,\n    'Due_Diligence_Status__c': transition.to == 'approved' ? 'Complete' : 'In Progress',\n    'Risk_Rating__c': scores.overall >= 80 ? 'Low' : \n                      scores.overall >= 60 ? 'Medium' : 'High',\n    'Next_Review_Date__c': scores.overall >= 70 ? \n                           timestamp.addDuration(duration('365d')).format('2006-01-02') :\n                           timestamp.addDuration(duration('90d')).format('2006-01-02'),\n    'Security_Score__c': scores.security,\n    'Compliance_Score__c': scores.compliance,\n    'Requires_Manual_Review__c': scores.overall \u003C 60\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis transformation runs within Fluvial before the webhook is delivered, eliminating the need for intermediate processing services. The webhook endpoint receives data already formatted for Salesforce's API.\n\n### Document Management\n\nDocument automation systems like SharePoint, DocuSign, and Box can be integrated for automatic filing, signature workflows, and secure file sharing during the questionnaire process.\n\n\n## Integration Patterns\n\n### Legal Due Diligence Automation\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Deal Opportunity Created] --> B[Fluvial API Triggered]\n    B --> C[Questionnaire Auto-Generated]\n    C --> D[Target Company Notified]\n    D --> E[Responses Collected]\n    E --> F[Webhook: Risk Analysis]\n    F --> G{Risk Level?}\n    G -->|Low| H[Auto-Approve]\n    G -->|Medium| I[Senior Review Required]\n    G -->|High| J[Committee Escalation]\n    H --> K[Update CRM]\n    I --> L[Assign to Senior Analyst]\n    J --> M[Create Executive Report]\n    K --> N[Trigger Contract Process]\n    L --> O[Review Complete]\n    M --> P[Schedule Committee Meeting]\n```\n\n### Financial Services Compliance\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant R as Regulatory System\n    participant Z as Fluvial\n    participant C as Compliance Team\n    participant A as Audit System\n    \n    R->>Z: Compliance Requirement Change\n    Z->>Z: Auto-Update Questionnaire Templates\n    Z->>C: Notify via Webhook\n    C->>Z: Review and Approve Changes\n    Z->>A: Log Compliance Event\n    Z->>R: Confirm Implementation\n```\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"info\" title=\"Audit Trails\">\nAll API calls and webhook deliveries are logged for regulatory review. Integration activity can be included in compliance reporting feeds.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## Developer Resources\n\nSDKs are available for Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Go. The platform provides sandbox environments for testing integrations, detailed error codes for troubleshooting, and performance monitoring for API response times and success rates.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nOrganizations typically begin by exploring the OpenAPI documentation, configuring webhooks for critical business processes, and implementing a pilot integration to validate the approach. After successful validation, additional systems can be connected to build comprehensive process automation.\n\n---","src/content/features/integration.mdx","26cfbf28ec16eedb","integration.mdx","workflow",{"id":2182,"data":2184,"body":2187,"filePath":2188,"digest":2189,"legacyId":2190,"deferredRender":2172},{"title":2185,"description":2186},"Workflow Customisation","Approval-gated workflows with readable CEL guard expressions, status-based permissions, and audit trails for regulated, multi-team processes.","import Callout from '../../components/featureWidgets/Callout.astro';\nimport Details from '../../components/featureWidgets/Details.astro';\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"tip\" title=\"Why Workflows Matter\">\nFluvial provides flexible workflow management that allows organisations to define custom business processes for their projects and other key activities. Instead of being locked into fixed, predetermined steps, you can create workflows that match your specific operational requirements.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n\nFluvia provides the ability to:\n- Track individual approvals against specific entities\n- Gate transitions based on approval status\n- Maintain detailed audit trails of who approved what and when\n- Configure complex, multi-tier approval requirements\n- Write business logic in human-readable guard expressions\n- Coordinate workflows across nested entity hierarchies\n\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"danger\" title=\"Readable Business Logic\">\n**Traditional Systems:** Endless configuration screens, rigid rules, project-specific settings that multiply complexity.\n\n**Fluvial's Approach:** Write business logic in readable expressions that capture your requirements.\n\n```\n// Replace configuration with clear rules\nuser.department == 'legal' && approval.risk_assessment \u003C= 'medium' \n  || user.role == 'managing_partner'\n```\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n### What Are Workflows?\n\nA workflow defines the lifecycle of business objects in your organisation - such as projects, issues, or procurement processes. Each workflow consists of:\n\n- **Statuses** - The different stages an item can be in (e.g., \"Draft\", \"Under Review\", \"Published\", \"Closed\")\n- **Transitions** - The allowed movements between statuses (e.g., moving from \"Draft\" to \"Under Review\")\n- **Actions** - What users can do at each status (e.g., edit details, approve, reject, publish)\n\n## Benefits\n\n### Organisational Flexibility\nDifferent organisations have different processes. Fluvial workflows adapt to your existing business rules rather than forcing you to change how you work.\n\n### Version Control\nWorkflows are versioned, allowing you to evolve your processes over time while maintaining historical consistency for existing projects.\n\n### Permission Integration\nEach status defines exactly what actions users can perform, ensuring proper governance and access control throughout your processes.\n\n### Customisable Business Logic\nAdvanced users can define custom rules that determine when transitions are allowed and what happens during status changes.\n\n## How Workflows Work\n\n### Status-Based Permissions\nAt any given status, users only see the actions they're permitted to perform. \n\n\u003CCallout type=\"info\" title=\"Permission Examples\">\n- **Draft** status: Authors can edit, save, or submit for review\n- **Under Review** status: Reviewers can approve, reject, or request changes\n- **Published** status: Limited users can archive or create amendments\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n### Controlled Transitions\nMoving between statuses is controlled and auditable. Users can only make transitions that are explicitly defined and for which they have permission.\n\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"tip\" title=\"Approval-Gated Transitions\">\nWorkflows can require formal approvals before allowing critical transitions. The system tracks who has approved what, and transition rules can verify that required approvals are in place before proceeding.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n### Guard Expressions - Business Logic in Readable form\n\nFluvial uses \"CEL\" (Common Expression Language), a readable and industry-standard expression language that lets you write complex business rules without programming. Instead of endless configuration screens, you write logical conditions that are simple to understand and maintain.\n\n\n**Access Control Example:**\n```\nuser.roles.contains('admin') || resource.owner == user.id\n```\n\n**Data Filtering Example:**\n```\ncreated_at.within(duration('24h')) && status == 'pending'\n```\n\n**Workflow Conditions Example:**\n```\napproval.status == 'approved' && budget.remaining >= cost\n```\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"info\" title=\"Guard Expressions\">\nGuard expressions provide a readable way to define business rules. Instead of multiple configuration screens, you write logical conditions that capture your requirements.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n### Context-Aware Rules\nWorkflows can incorporate business rules that consider the current state of the project, user roles, deadlines, approval status, and other contextual factors.\n\n### Nested Workflow Scopes\n\u003CCallout type=\"tip\" title=\"Hierarchical Business Logic\">\nFluvial supports nested workflow scopes where parent and child entities can have independent workflows that interact intelligently. A **Project** contains many **Responses**, each with their own workflow, but child workflows can trigger parent transitions when guard conditions are met.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n**Example: Coordinated Transition Logic**\n- Child **Response** workflows attempt to transition parent **Project** from \"Responding\" to \"Scoring\"\n- Parent transition only fires when guard condition is satisfied:\n\n```\nall_responses.all(r, r.status == 'submitted') && responses.size() >= minimum_required\n```\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"info\" title=\"Business Logic\">\nThis expresses the business rule *\"All responses shall be considered over the same period of time\"* in readable logic.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## Workflow Management\n\n### Creating Workflows\nAdministrators can create new workflows for different types of business processes. Each workflow is specific to:\n- A particular entity type (projects, issues, etc.)\n- Your organisation\n- A specific version for change management\n\n### Workflow Designer\nThe workflow designer provides a visual interface for:\n- Defining statuses and their properties\n- Setting up transitions between statuses\n- Configuring permissions for each status\n- **Writing guard expressions in -English CEL language**\n- Adding business rules and validation logic\n- Specifying required approvals for transitions\n- **Creating cross-scope transition logic between parent and child workflows**\n\n### Deployment and Testing\nNew workflows can be tested and refined before being deployed to live operations, ensuring business continuity during process improvements.\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n### Due Diligence Questionnaire Lifecycle\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Question Development] --> B[Legal Review]\n    B --> C[Domain Expert Review]\n    C --> D[Client Review]\n    D --> E[Published]\n    E --> F[Response Collection]\n    F --> G[Answer Review]\n    G --> H[Legal Sign-off]\n    H --> I[Final Approval]\n    I --> J[Completed]\n    \n    %% Skip transitions\n    A -.-> D\n    B -.-> E\n    \n    %% Backtrack transitions\n    D -.-> B\n    G -.-> F\n    H -.-> G\n    I -.-> H\n```\n\n\n- **Legal Review** requires lawyer approval before questions can be published\n- **Answer Review** requires domain expert approval of all responses\n- **Legal Sign-off** requires legal counsel approval of final answers before completion\n\n\n\u003CDetails summary=\"Guard Expression Examples\">\n**Legal Review Transition:**\n```\napprovals.legal.size() >= 1 && approvals.legal.exists(a, a.role == 'corporate_counsel')\n```\n\n**Answer Review to Legal Sign-off:**\n```\nresponses.all(r, r.status == 'expert_approved') && risk_level \u003C= 'medium'\n```\n\n**High-Risk Escalation:**\n```\nrisk_level == 'high' && approvals.size() >= 2 && approvals.exists(a, a.role == 'partner')\n```\n\u003C/Details>\n\n### Regulatory Compliance Questionnaire\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Draft] --> B[Compliance Review]\n    B --> C[Risk Assessment]\n    C --> D[Executive Review]\n    D --> E[Issued]\n    E --> F[Response Received]\n    F --> G[Technical Review]\n    G --> H[Legal Validation]\n    H --> I[Approved]\n    I --> J[Filed]\n    \n    %% Skip transitions for expedited processing\n    A -.-> C\n    B -.-> D\n    C -.-> E\n    \n    %% Backtrack transitions for revisions\n    D -.-> B\n    E -.-> C\n    G -.-> F\n    H -.-> G\n    I -.-> H\n```\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"warning\" title=\"Advanced Approval Requirements\">\n- **Executive Review** requires board level approval for high-risk questionnaires\n- **Legal Validation** requires both in-house and external counsel approval\n- **Filed** status only available after all required regulatory approvals logged\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n### M&A Due Diligence Process\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Scope Definition] --> B[Question Bank Assembly]\n    B --> C[Legal Clearance]\n    C --> D[Issued to Target]\n    D --> E[Response Collection]\n    E --> F[Expert Analysis]\n    F --> G[Risk Assessment]\n    G --> H[Final Review]\n    H --> I[Deal Recommendation]\n    \n    %% Emergency skip transitions\n    A -.-> C\n    B -.-> D\n    F -.-> H\n    \n    %% Backtrack for revisions and corrections\n    C -.-> B\n    D -.-> C\n    F -.-> E\n    G -.-> F\n    H -.-> G\n    I -.-> H\n```\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"danger\" title=\"Multi-Tier Approval Example\">\n- **Legal Clearance** requires approval from corporate counsel and external M&A specialists\n- **Final Review** requires sign-off from deal team lead, legal counsel, and subject matter experts in each domain covered\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **Review Default Workflows** -

Fluvial connects questionnaire responses to document templates, reducing manual data entry.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## The Challenge\n\nAfter collecting questionnaire data, information typically needs to be transferred into contracts, reports, and other documents. Manual copying can be time-consuming and may introduce errors.\n\n## How Fluvial Works\n\nFluvial connects documents to questionnaire data through defined mappings.\n\n### Define Your Document Structure\n\nCreate templates for the types of documents you need—vendor profiles, compliance reports, service agreements, or rating summaries. These templates define what information each document contains and how it should be organised.\n\n### Connect Questions to Documents\n\nSet up reusable connections between your questionnaire questions and document fields. When a question asks for a company name, certification status, or risk rating, you specify where that information should appear in your documents. These connections can be saved and used again for future assessments.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\nsubgraph Q1[\"Risk Assessment Project A\"]\nQE1[\"Q 123\u003Cbr/>Company Name: 'Acme Corp'\"]\nQE2[\"Q 125\u003Cbr/>Revenue: '50M'\"]\nend\n\n    subgraph Q2[\"Due Diligence Project B\"]\n        QE3[\"Q 456\u003Cbr/>Company Address: '123 Main St'\"]\n        QE4[\"Q 458\u003Cbr/>Industry: 'Technology'\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph CM[\"ContentMap: Vendor Profile\"]\n        direction TB\n        P1[\"Q 123 → /company/name\"]\n        P2[\"Q 125 → /financial/revenue\"]\n        P3[\"Q 456 → /company/address\"]\n        P4[\"Q 458 → /company/industry\"]\n    end\n\n\n    subgraph CD[\"Content Document\"]\n        direction TB\n        JSON[\"Populated Content\u003Cbr/>{\u003Cbr/>  'company': {\u003Cbr/>    'name': 'Acme Corp',\u003Cbr/>    'address': '123 Main St',\u003Cbr/>    'industry': 'Technology'\u003Cbr/>  },\u003Cbr/>  'financial': {\u003Cbr/>    'revenue': '50M'\u003Cbr/>  }\u003Cbr/>}\"]\n    end\n\n    QE1 --> P1\n    QE2 --> P2\n    QE3 --> P3\n    QE4 --> P4\n\n    P1 --> JSON\n    P2 --> JSON\n    P3 --> JSON\n    P4 --> JSON\n\n\n    style Q1 fill:#e1f5ff\n    style Q2 fill:#e1f5ff\n    style CD fill:#e8f5e9\n\n```\n\n### Generate and Update Documents\n\nOnce connections are established, Fluvial can automatically create documents from questionnaire responses. When source information changes, you can choose to update the documents automatically or review changes before approving them. The system keeps track of what changed, when, and why.\n\n### Share in Any Format\n\nWhile Fluvial stores document data in a structured way, you can output documents in whatever format you need—PDF for distribution, HTML for web viewing, or data feeds for other systems. Your branding and formatting preferences are maintained in customizable templates.\n\n## Building Organisational Knowledge\n\nBeyond individual projects, Fluvial helps organize information into a reference library. Documents can be organized by the entities they describe (vendors, regions, industries), with access controls and change tracking.\n\n## Real-World Example\n\n**Advisory Firm Building Vendor Intelligence**\n\nAn advisory firm conducts vendor evaluations for clients. They use Fluvial to build a database of vendor information.\n\nThey create a standard vendor profile template that captures capabilities, certifications, performance history, and risk factors. When conducting a client assessment, questionnaire responses populate these profiles. As they complete more projects, their vendor database grows.\n\nFor subsequent client engagements, they can reference existing vendor information while keeping client-specific details confidential. The audit trail documents how assessments were conducted.\n\nVisit our [Solutions](/solutions/) to see how document automation applies to specific industries and use cases.\n\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\nDocuments can move through approval processes with whatever stages you need, e.g. draft, review, approved, and published. Set up requirements for legal or compliance sign-off before documents are finalised, and trigger notifications or system updates when documents reach certain milestones. These [workflows](/features/workflow) can be customised using a [GUI workflow builder](/features/workflow) and simple expression language policies.\n\n\u003CDetails summary=\"Expression Language for Workflow Control\">\nControl workflow transitions using flexible business rules with Common Expression Language (CEL):\n\n```javascript\n// Allow access to vendor profiles for users in procurement or legal\nuser.roles.contains(\"procurement\") || user.roles.contains(\"legal\")\n\n// Restrict sensitive financial data to senior analysts\nentity.data_classification == \"financial\" && user.seniority >= \"senior\"\n\n// Organisation-based access control\nentity.author_org_id == user.org.id\n\n// Time-based restrictions\nnow.getHours() >= 9 && now.getHours() \u003C 17\n```\n\nThese expressions determine who can view, edit, or approve documents, and under what conditions workflow transitions can occur.\n\u003C/Details>\n\n## What Makes Fluvial Different\n\nMost questionnaire platforms offer basic export features—typically PDFs or spreadsheets.\n\nFluvial maintains connections between source data and documents. Information can be updated, mappings can be reused across projects, and the system records how documents were created and modified. This transforms your assessment data from isolated project artifacts into organisational assets that compound in value over time.","src/content/features/document-management.mdx","3b919429bc80f1ca","document-management.mdx","solutions",["Map",2202,2203,2243,2244,2284,2285,2325,2326,2366,2367],"compliance",{"id":2202,"data":2204,"body":2207,"filePath":2208,"digest":2209,"rendered":2210,"legacyId":2242},{"title":2205,"description":2206},"Financial Services Compliance","KYC/AML compliance with risk-scored questionnaires, gated approvals, audit-ready documentation, and integrations for automated regulatory reporting.","Financial institutions operate under extensive regulatory oversight requiring systematic assessment of counterparty risk, operational controls, and regulatory capital adequacy. Compliance teams must conduct ongoing assessments while maintaining documentation suitable for regulatory examination.\n\n## The Financial Compliance Challenge\n\nRegulatory requirements demand that financial institutions assess customer risk (KYC), monitor for money laundering (AML), evaluate operational resilience, and calculate regulatory capital requirements. These assessments involve complex scoring methodologies, multi-tier approval requirements, and extensive documentation that regulators expect to review during examinations.\n\n## How Fluvial Supports Financial Compliance\n\n### Risk Assessment Frameworks\n\nFluvial's [questionnaire capabilities](/features/questionnaire) implement regulatory assessment frameworks with multi-dimensional scoring and weighting. KYC questionnaires use weighted questions to calculate customer risk ratings, determining monitoring requirements and approval levels. AML assessments incorporate both quantitative thresholds and qualitative risk factors, producing composite risk scores that drive compliance decisions.\n\n### Regulatory Approval Requirements\n\nFinancial compliance often requires documented approvals from compliance officers, legal counsel, and senior management. The [workflow system](/features/workflow) enforces these approval gates, preventing customer onboarding or transaction execution until required approvals are obtained. CEL guard expressions ensure high-risk relationships receive appropriate executive review before approval.\n\n### Compliance Documentation\n\nRegulatory examinations require comprehensive documentation showing assessment methodology, risk classification logic, and approval decisions. [document automation](/features/document-management) transforms assessment data into compliance reports, customer risk profiles, and regulatory submissions. Audit trails demonstrate exactly how customer risk ratings were determined and who approved high-risk relationships.\n\n### Regulatory Reporting Integration\n\n[API integration](/features/integration) enables automated regulatory reporting. Compliance assessment data feeds directly into regulatory reporting systems, eliminating manual compilation of examination responses. When regulators request documentation of specific risk assessments, webhook notifications can automatically package relevant questionnaire responses, approvals, and audit trails for submission.\n\n## Key Capabilities for Financial Compliance\n\n**Risk-Based Customer Onboarding** - Assessment scores automatically determine customer due diligence requirements and approval levels, ensuring appropriate scrutiny for high-risk relationships.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring** - Periodic reassessment workflows ensure customer risk profiles remain current, with automated scheduling based on risk classification.\n\n**Examination Readiness** - Complete audit trails of assessment methodology, risk scoring, and approval decisions provide documentation regulators expect during examinations.\n\n**Regulatory Change Management** - When compliance requirements change, assessment frameworks and scoring methodologies can be versioned, maintaining consistency for existing customers while applying new standards to new assessments.\n\n## Typical Compliance Workflow\n\nA prospective customer completes a KYC questionnaire, with responses automatically scored based on regulatory risk factors. Low-risk customers proceed to standard approval, while high-risk profiles trigger enhanced due diligence and senior management review. Once approved, the customer enters ongoing monitoring status with reassessment scheduled based on risk classification.\n\nThroughout this process, every assessment, risk rating calculation, and approval decision is documented with complete audit trails suitable for regulatory examination.\n\n---\n\nFluvial provides financial institutions with the structured assessment frameworks, approval controls, and documentation rigor required to meet regulatory compliance obligations while maintaining operational efficiency.","src/content/solutions/compliance.md","51f32e66ea431082",{"html":2211,"metadata":2212},"\u003Cp>Financial institutions operate under extensive regulatory oversight requiring systematic assessment of counterparty risk, operational controls, and regulatory capital adequacy.

Contract management systems receive executed SLAs with direct links to the source questionnaire responses.\n\n## Key Capabilities for Procurement\n\n**Objective Vendor Comparison** - Weighted scoring provides quantitative vendor rankings, supporting defensible selection decisions and reducing subjective bias.\n\n**Stakeholder Coordination** - Multi-function review workflows ensure all relevant teams evaluate vendors in their areas of expertise before selection decisions are finalised.\n\n**Commitment Enforcement** - Mapping vendor assessment responses to contract terms ensures vendor commitments become legally enforceable obligations.\n\n**Vendor Performance Tracking** - Ongoing assessments verify vendors continue meeting commitments, with workflows triggering contract review when vendor capabilities decline.\n\n## Typical Procurement Workflow\n\nA request for proposal generates vendor questionnaires tailored to specific procurement requirements. Vendors respond with capability descriptions, pricing, and service commitments. Cross-functional teams review responses in their respective areas, scoring vendors against weighted evaluation criteria.\n\nThe highest-scoring vendor proceeds to contract negotiation, with questionnaire responses populating the service level agreement.

Fluvial provides a comprehensive platform for assessing, monitoring, and managing these relationships throughout their lifecycle.\n\n## The TPRM Challenge\n\nThird-party risk management extends beyond initial vendor selection. Organisations must continuously assess vendor security posture, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and operational capabilities while maintaining audit trails that satisfy regulatory requirements. This ongoing assessment generates substantial documentation that must be maintained, updated, and made available for review.\n\n## How Fluvial Addresses TPRM Requirements\n\n### Comprehensive Vendor Assessment\n\nFluvial's [questionnaire management system](/features/questionnaire) supports multi-dimensional vendor evaluations covering security, compliance, financial stability, and operational capabilities. Hierarchical question organisation allows assessment frameworks to mirror regulatory standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR) while weighted scoring provides risk-based vendor classification.\n\n### Approval-Gated Review Processes\n\nThe [workflow system](/features/workflow) enforces multi-tier review requirements common in TPRM programs. Security teams review technical controls, legal teams verify contractual protections, and risk committees approve high-risk vendor relationships. CEL-based guard expressions ensure vendors cannot be onboarded until all required approvals are obtained and risk thresholds are met.\n\n### Vendor Profile Documentation\n\n[Structured document automation](/features/document-management) transforms assessment responses into maintained vendor profiles. Security questionnaire responses populate vendor risk profiles that serve as reference documentation across the organisation. When vendors undergo reassessment, mappings update existing profiles while JSON Patch audit trails preserve the complete history of risk rating changes.\n\n### Continuous Monitoring Integration\n\n[API integration](/features/integration) enables real-time updates from external risk intelligence sources. Webhook notifications alert risk teams when vendor security incidents occur, financial ratings change, or compliance certifications expire. Webhook-driven automation can automatically trigger reassessment workflows when vendor risk profiles change materially.\n\n## Key Capabilities for TPRM\n\n**Vendor Lifecycle Management** - From initial assessment through ongoing monitoring to off-boarding, workflows track vendor status and ensure periodic reassessment occurs on schedule.\n\n**Risk-Based Classification** - Weighted scoring automatically categorizes vendors into risk tiers, determining reassessment frequency and approval requirements.\n\n**Regulatory Audit Support** - Complete audit trails demonstrate vendor assessment rigor, approval documentation, and continuous monitoring compliance for regulatory examinations.\n\n**Reference Data Accumulation** - Organisations build proprietary vendor intelligence databases, with each assessment enriching institutional knowledge about vendor capabilities and risks.\n\n## Typical TPRM Workflow\n\nA vendor progresses from initial assessment through security review, legal evaluation, and risk committee approval. High-risk vendors require additional executive sign-off before onboarding. Once approved, the vendor profile enters continuous monitoring status, with automated alerts triggering reassessment when risk indicators change.\n\nThroughout this lifecycle, every assessment, approval decision, and risk rating change is documented with complete audit trails suitable for regulatory examination.\n\n---\n\nFluvial transforms third-party risk management from a compliance exercise into a systematic risk intelligence capability, providing organisations with comprehensive vendor visibility while maintaining the rigorous controls required in regulated environments.","src/content/solutions/tprm.md","b48fc179517f615c",{"html":2334,"metadata":2335},"\u003Cp>Organisations increasingly rely on external vendors, suppliers, and service providers, creating complex webs of third-party relationships that introduce operational, security, and compliance risks.
