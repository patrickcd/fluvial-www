title: Vendor Selection & Procurement
description: "Evaluate and select vendors with structured questionnaires, cross-functional workflows, SLA document generation, and integrations across procurement systems."

Strategic sourcing and vendor selection processes require systematic evaluation of supplier capabilities, financial stability, and service commitments. Procurement teams must compare vendors across multiple dimensions while documenting selection decisions and translating vendor commitments into enforceable contract terms.

## The Procurement Challenge

Vendor selection extends beyond price comparison. Organisations must assess technical capabilities, financial stability, security posture, and operational resilience. Vendor commitments made during the selection process should flow into service level agreements, creating enforceable obligations. The entire selection process requires documentation suitable for audit and contract negotiation.

## How Fluvial Supports Procurement

### Comprehensive Vendor Evaluation

Fluvial's [questionnaire system](/features/questionnaire) structures vendor assessments across technical capabilities, financial metrics, security controls, and service delivery commitments. Weighted scoring enables objective vendor comparisonâ€”technical capabilities might receive 40% weight, financial stability 30%, and security posture 30%, producing composite scores that support evidence-based selection decisions.

### Cross-Functional Review

Vendor selection typically requires input from technical teams, finance, legal, and security. The [workflow system](/features/workflow) coordinates this review, routing technical questions to engineering teams, financial assessments to finance, and security evaluations to information security. Approval gates ensure stakeholders from all relevant functions approve the vendor before contract execution.

### Contract Population

Vendor commitments should become contract terms. [document automation](/features/document-management) capabilities map vendor questionnaire responses directly to service level agreements. Uptime commitments, response time guarantees, and security control requirements flow from assessment responses into SLA templates, ensuring alignment between vendor representations and contractual obligations.

### Procurement System Integration

[API integration](/features/integration) connects vendor selection to procurement and ERP systems. When vendors are approved, their information automatically populates vendor master records. Purchase order systems can verify that vendors have current assessments before allowing procurement. Contract management systems receive executed SLAs with direct links to the source questionnaire responses.

## Key Capabilities for Procurement

**Objective Vendor Comparison** - Weighted scoring provides quantitative vendor rankings, supporting defensible selection decisions and reducing subjective bias.

**Stakeholder Coordination** - Multi-function review workflows ensure all relevant teams evaluate vendors in their areas of expertise before selection decisions are finalised.

**Commitment Enforcement** - Mapping vendor assessment responses to contract terms ensures vendor commitments become legally enforceable obligations.

**Vendor Performance Tracking** - Ongoing assessments verify vendors continue meeting commitments, with workflows triggering contract review when vendor capabilities decline.

## Typical Procurement Workflow

A request for proposal generates vendor questionnaires tailored to specific procurement requirements. Vendors respond with capability descriptions, pricing, and service commitments. Cross-functional teams review responses in their respective areas, scoring vendors against weighted evaluation criteria.

The highest-scoring vendor proceeds to contract negotiation, with questionnaire responses populating the service level agreement. The vendor profile, including all assessment scores and approval decisions, becomes the permanent record of the selection process.
