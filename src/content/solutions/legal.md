Legal due diligence processes—whether for M&A transactions, corporate governance reviews, or regulatory compliance verification—require systematic information gathering across multiple legal domains and jurisdictions. The complexity of these assessments demands sophisticated questionnaire management, rigorous approval controls, and comprehensive documentation capabilities.

## The Legal Due Diligence Challenge

Legal teams must assess corporate structure, regulatory compliance, intellectual property portfolios, litigation exposure, and contractual relationships across potentially dozens of jurisdictions. Each area requires specialised expertise, and conclusions must be documented with sufficient detail to support transaction decisions or regulatory submissions. The information gathered often populates legal opinions, disclosure schedules, and compliance reports that become permanent transaction records.

## How Fluvial Supports Legal Due Diligence

### Structured Legal Assessments

Fluvial's [questionnaire system](/features/questionnaire) organizes legal due diligence inquiries hierarchically—corporate structure, regulatory compliance, IP portfolios, litigation history, and material contracts each form major sections with unlimited subsections for jurisdictional or topic-specific detail. This structure mirrors how legal teams organize their analysis while ensuring no assessment area is overlooked.

### Multi-Expert Review Workflows

Legal due diligence requires coordination among specialists. The [workflow system](/features/workflow) routes corporate governance questions to M&A counsel, IP matters to patent specialists, and regulatory compliance to subject matter experts. Approval gates ensure senior partners review high-risk findings before conclusions are finalised. CEL guard expressions can require both local and international counsel approval for cross-border matters.

### Legal Documentation Generation

Assessment responses populate legal deliverables through [document automation](/features/document-management) capabilities. Due diligence findings flow into legal opinions, representations and warranties schedules, and disclosure documents. Persistent mappings ensure that when diligence findings are refined, dependent documents update automatically while maintaining complete audit trails of what changed and why.

### Integration with Matter Management

[API integration](/features/integration) connects due diligence processes to legal matter management systems, document repositories, and contract databases. Diligence questionnaires can pull existing contract data, reducing manual data entry. Completion of due diligence phases triggers notifications to transaction teams and updates matter status in firm-wide systems.

## Key Capabilities for Legal Processes

**Multi-Jurisdictional Assessment** - Hierarchical organisation supports jurisdiction-specific legal inquiries while maintaining overall assessment structure.

**Expert Collaboration** - Section-level permissions ensure specialised counsel sees relevant questions while maintaining appropriate confidentiality for sensitive findings.

**Opinion Documentation** - Questionnaire responses populate legal opinion templates, with mappings ensuring consistency between diligence findings and legal conclusions.

**Transaction Audit Trails** - Complete documentation of assessment methodology, expert review, and conclusion approval provides defensible evidence of diligence quality.

## Typical Legal Due Diligence Workflow

Initial scoping defines assessment areas and assigns responsibility to appropriate legal specialists. As responses are gathered, findings requiring escalation trigger senior review workflows. High-risk issues may require external counsel consultation before conclusions are approved.

Once diligence is complete, findings populate disclosure schedules, legal opinions, and transaction documentation. The complete assessment record, including all expert reviews and approvals, is preserved as the permanent record of diligence conducted.
