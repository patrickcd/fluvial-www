Financial institutions operate under extensive regulatory oversight requiring systematic assessment of counterparty risk, operational controls, and regulatory capital adequacy. Compliance teams must conduct ongoing assessments while maintaining documentation suitable for regulatory examination.

## The Financial Compliance Challenge

Regulatory requirements demand that financial institutions assess customer risk (KYC), monitor for money laundering (AML), evaluate operational resilience, and calculate regulatory capital requirements. These assessments involve complex scoring methodologies, multi-tier approval requirements, and extensive documentation that regulators expect to review during examinations.

## How Fluvial Supports Financial Compliance

### Risk Assessment Frameworks

Fluvial's [questionnaire capabilities](/features/questionnaire) implement regulatory assessment frameworks with multi-dimensional scoring and weighting. KYC questionnaires use weighted questions to calculate customer risk ratings, determining monitoring requirements and approval levels. AML assessments incorporate both quantitative thresholds and qualitative risk factors, producing composite risk scores that drive compliance decisions.

### Regulatory Approval Requirements

Financial compliance often requires documented approvals from compliance officers, legal counsel, and senior management. The [workflow system](/features/workflow) enforces these approval gates, preventing customer onboarding or transaction execution until required approvals are obtained. CEL guard expressions ensure high-risk relationships receive appropriate executive review before approval.

### Compliance Documentation

Regulatory examinations require comprehensive documentation showing assessment methodology, risk classification logic, and approval decisions. [document automation](/features/document-management) transforms assessment data into compliance reports, customer risk profiles, and regulatory submissions. Audit trails demonstrate exactly how customer risk ratings were determined and who approved high-risk relationships.

### Regulatory Reporting Integration

[API integration](/features/integration) enables automated regulatory reporting. Compliance assessment data feeds directly into regulatory reporting systems, eliminating manual compilation of examination responses. When regulators request documentation of specific risk assessments, webhook notifications can automatically package relevant questionnaire responses, approvals, and audit trails for submission.

## Key Capabilities for Financial Compliance

**Risk-Based Customer Onboarding** - Assessment scores automatically determine customer due diligence requirements and approval levels, ensuring appropriate scrutiny for high-risk relationships.

**Ongoing Monitoring** - Periodic reassessment workflows ensure customer risk profiles remain current, with automated scheduling based on risk classification.

**Examination Readiness** - Complete audit trails of assessment methodology, risk scoring, and approval decisions provide documentation regulators expect during examinations.

**Regulatory Change Management** - When compliance requirements change, assessment frameworks and scoring methodologies can be versioned, maintaining consistency for existing customers while applying new standards to new assessments.

## Typical Compliance Workflow

A prospective customer completes a KYC questionnaire, with responses automatically scored based on regulatory risk factors. Low-risk customers proceed to standard approval, while high-risk profiles trigger enhanced due diligence and senior management review. Once approved, the customer enters ongoing monitoring status with reassessment scheduled based on risk classification.

Throughout this process, every assessment, risk rating calculation, and approval decision is documented with complete audit trails suitable for regulatory examination.
