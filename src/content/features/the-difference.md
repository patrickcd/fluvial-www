title: Fluvial TPRM Software for the AI Age 
description: Fluvial is a TPRM designed for the AI age. It exposes novel levels of customisation whilst leavening the complexity burder with AI integration.

## The Waterbed Theory of Complexity

Complexity is an inevitable feature of useful productivity software. Different software architectures can reduce complexity in one area, only to find it popping up somewhere else.

Fluvial knowingly pushes complexity onto the user, and, in so doing, provides the user with greatly enhanced capabilities. Until recently, this would demand extensive training, documentation and probably a consulting integration business.

AI changes this assumption. Agentic AI can make API calls on behalf of the user. AI Chat can write expression language policies to change the system's behaviour. RAG assisted features can automate data processing.
