<Callout type="tip" title="Why Questionnaire Excellence Matters">
Fluvial's questionnaire system transforms how organisations create, deploy, and analyse complex assessments. Whether you're conducting due diligence, compliance reviews, vendor assessments, or risk evaluations, our platform provides professional questionnaire capabilities that scale with your business needs.
</Callout>

## What Makes Fluvial's Questionnaires Different?

Unlike simple survey tools, Fluvial questionnaires are designed for mission-critical business processes where accuracy, control, and analytical depth are paramount. Our system provides the flexibility to handle everything from simple compliance checklists to complex multi-party due diligence exercises.

### Question Building
Create flexible questions using multiple input types:
- **Rich Text Fields** - Multi-line responses with formatting support and validation rules
- **Multiple Choice Options** - Radio buttons and dropdown selections with automated scoring
- **Checkboxes** - Boolean responses for compliance and verification requirements
- **File Attachments** - Supporting documents, evidence, and supplementary materials
- **Embedded Media** - Links to external resources, videos, and reference materials

### Intelligent Question Organisation
<Callout type="warning" title="Key Differentiator">
Fluvial's hierarchical section system allows unlimited nesting of topics and subtopics, enabling you to mirror complex organisational structures and regulatory frameworks exactly as they exist in your business domain.
</Callout>

## Sophisticated Weighting and Scoring

### Multi-Dimensional Scoring System
Unlike basic survey tools that treat all questions equally, Fluvial provides flexible scoring capabilities:

#### Flexible Weighting Strategies
- **Question-Level Weights** - Assign importance to individual questions
- **Section-Level Weights** - Weight entire categories or compliance areas
- **Multiple Weighting Sets** - Different scoring perspectives for the same questionnaire
- **Normalised Calculations** - Automatically adjust scores when questionnaire structure changes

#### Automated Scoring Intelligence
<Callout type="tip" title="Smart Scoring Features">
- **Multiple Choice Auto-Scoring** - Pre-configured point values for standardized responses
- **AI-Powered Qualitative Analysis** - Machine learning assessment of free-text responses
- **Relative Scoring Algorithms** - Compare responses across multiple respondents
- **Custom Scoring Rules** - Define complex business logic for specialised assessments
</Callout>

### Real-World Scoring Example

```mermaid

    A[Financial Due Diligence] --> B[Revenue Quality - 40%]
    A --> C[Cost Structure - 30%] 
    A --> D[Cash Flow - 20%]
    A --> E[Accounting Practices - 10%]
    
    B --> B1[Revenue Recognition - 60%]
    B --> B2[Customer Concentration - 40%]
    
    C --> C1[Fixed Costs - 70%]
    C --> C2[Variable Costs - 30%]
```

<Callout type="info" title="Advanced Weighting Benefits">
This allows the same questionnaire to be scored differently for various stakeholders - legal teams might weight compliance higher, while financial teams prioritize revenue quality.
</Callout>

## Collaborative Response Management

### Status-Driven Response Workflow
For respondents, aach question can progress through a workflow:

- **Not Answered** - Initial state, awaiting respondent input
- **Answered** - Response provided, ready for review
- **For Review** - Flagged for expert evaluation
- **Rejected** - Requires revision or additional information
- **Approved** - Validated and accepted by reviewers

### Multi-Party Collaboration
<Callout type="warning" title="Enterprise Requirement">
Unlike consumer survey tools, Fluvial supports complex multi-stakeholder scenarios where different users have different roles and permissions within the same questionnaire.
</Callout>

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Section-Level Permissions** - Control who can see and respond to specific areas
- **Response Assignment** - Allocate questions to specific team members
- **Review Hierarchies** - Multi-tier approval processes for critical responses
- **Audit Trails** - Complete history of who answered what and when

## Content Reusability and Efficiency
