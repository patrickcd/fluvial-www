# Integration Platform

::: tip Why Integration Excellence Matters
Fluvial's integration capabilities ensure your questionnaire and workflow processes seamlessly connect with existing business systems. Rather than operating as an isolated tool, Fluvial becomes the orchestration layer that connects due diligence, compliance, and assessment processes across your entire technology ecosystem.
:::

## What Sets Fluvial's Integration Apart?

Unlike basic survey platforms that offer limited export options, Fluvial provides comprehensive integration capabilities designed for enterprise environments where questionnaire data must flow seamlessly between multiple systems, trigger automated processes, and maintain real-time synchronization with business-critical applications.

### Complete API-First Architecture
Every capability available in Fluvial's user interface is accessible through our comprehensive REST APIs:

#### 100% Feature Parity
- **Questionnaire Management** - Create, modify, and deploy questionnaires programmatically
- **Response Collection** - Automated answer submission and validation
- **Workflow Control** - Trigger status transitions and approvals via API
- **Real-Time Analytics** - Access scoring, weighting, and analytical data
- **User Management** - Provision users, assign permissions, and manage access

#### OpenAPI Specification Compliance
::: warning Enterprise Standards
All APIs are fully documented using OpenApi 3.1 specifications, ensuring:
- **Automatic SDK Generation** - Create client libraries in any programming language
- **Interactive Documentation** - Explore and test APIs directly from documentation
- **Contract-First Development** - Guarantee API stability and backward compatibility
- **Integration Testing** - Validate integrations against standardized specifications
:::

#### Developer-Friendly Implementation
```javascript
// Example: Create questionnaire and trigger workflow
const questionnaire = await Fluvial.questionnaires.create({
  title: "Vendor Security Assessment",
  sections: vendorSections,
  workflow: "security-review"
});

// Automatically assign to security team
await Fluvial.workflows.transition(questionnaire.id, 'security-review', {
  assignTo: 'security-team@company.com'
});
```

## Real-Time Event System

### Intelligent Webhook Architecture
Fluvial's webhook system provides real-time notifications for business-critical events, enabling immediate responses to questionnaire activities:

#### Comprehensive Event Coverage
- **Response Events** - Answer submissions, modifications, and validations
- **Workflow Events** - Status transitions, approvals, and rejections  
- **User Events** - Login activities, permission changes, and assignment updates
- **System Events** - Integration failures, performance alerts, and security notifications

#### Smart Event Filtering
::: tip Advanced Event Management
Configure webhooks with filtering rules:
- **Event Type Filtering** - Only receive notifications for specific event categories
- **Project-Based Filtering** - Limit events to specific questionnaires or business units
- **Conditional Logic** - Trigger webhooks based on response content, scoring thresholds, or approval status
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevent webhook flooding while ensuring critical events are delivered

#### Reliable Delivery Guarantees
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Z as Fluvial
    participant W as Webhook Endpoint
    participant R as Retry Queue
    
    Z->>W: Event Notification
    alt Success Response
        W->>Z: 200 OK
    else Failure Response
        W->>Z: 4xx/5xx Error
        Z->>R: Queue for Retry
        R->>W: Retry with Backoff
    end
```

::: warning Delivery Assurance
- **Automatic Retries** - Exponential backoff for failed deliveries
- **Dead Letter Queues** - Capture permanently failed events for manual review
- **Delivery Confirmation** - Cryptographic signatures verify authentic event delivery
- **Monitoring Dashboards** - Real-time visibility into webhook performance and failures
:::

## Advanced Workflow Automation

### Webhook-Driven Automation
Fluvial's workflow system uses webhooks with guard expressions and CEL data transforms to automate business processes when questionnaires transition between statuses:

#### Event-Driven Automation
When workflow transitions occur, Fluvial sends webhook notifications to configured endpoints with rich context data. Your systems can then execute automated actions:

**Example Webhook Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "workflow.transition",
  "questionnaire_id": "q_12345",
  "from_status": "security-review",
  "to_status": "approved",
  "scores": {
    "overall": 85,
    "security": 90,
    "compliance": 80
  },
  "responses": { /* response data */ },
  "user": { /* user context */ },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### CEL Guard Expressions
Configure webhooks to fire conditionally based on CEL expressions evaluated against event data:

```javascript
// Only trigger for high-risk assessments
scores.overall < 50

// Trigger for specific workflow transitions
transition.to == 'approved' and scores.security > 75

// Complex conditional logic
risk_level == 'high' and department == 'finance' and approval_count < 2
```

#### CEL Data Transforms
Transform webhook payloads before delivery using CEL expressions, enabling you to:
- Extract specific fields for external system consumption
- Calculate derived values from response data
- Format data to match receiving system's schema
- Filter sensitive information before transmission

**Transform Example:**
```javascript
{
  'vendor_id': questionnaire.vendor_id,
  'risk_score': scores.overall,
  'status': transition.to,
  'requires_review': scores.overall < 60,
  'reviewer_email': scores.overall < 60 ? 'senior-analyst@company.com' : 'analyst@company.com'
}
```

#### Automation Use Cases
::: tip Webhook Automation Features
- **Dynamic Routing** - Webhook receivers route work based on response content and risk profiles
- **Conditional Logic** - CEL guards ensure automation only triggers when conditions are met
- **External System Integration** - Update CRM records, create tickets, trigger approval workflows
- **Notification Management** - Send alerts to appropriate teams based on assessment outcomes
- **Document Generation** - Trigger report generation when assessments complete
:::
